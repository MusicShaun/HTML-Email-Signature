Crafting a HTML email signature is a nightmare. There are compatibility quirks, design challenges, and no support from the big email providers. This readMe is a quick overview of the important lessons I learned and the pitfalls to avoid. Be very strict unless you are happy to waste some time.

## Things that will save you time:

- **Don't Use Media Queries**: They often don't work across all email clients.
- **Stick to a Mobile Version**: Without reliable media query support, stick to a mobile version.
- **Don't Use SVGs**: Gmail has limited support for SVG images.
- **Images Need Transparent Backgrounds**: Ensure your images have transparent backgrounds to accommodate dark mode. A white backgrounded image will be email suicide at night time. 
- **Use Referenced Images**: Support for referenced images is generally good. ie: /<*img src="link" />* 
- **KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid)**: Complexity will lead to headaches.
- **Tables**: Tables are the standard for compatibility.
- **Read The Ultimate Guide to CSS & Email linked below**

## How to Inject Your Signature into Apple, Gmail & Outlook

### Apple Mail:
One does not simply drag and drop an HTML signature into apple preferences. Follow these [instructions](https://www.hubspot.com/email-signature-generator/add-html-signature-mail-mac).

### Gmail: 
Install the Chrome extension *"[Insert HTML by Designmodo](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/insert-html-by-designmodo/bcflbfdlpegakpncdgmejelcolhmfkjh)"* to copy and paste your HTML code into Gmail's signature box.

### Outlook: 
Install the Microsoft extension *"[Insert HTML by Designmodo](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/wa200002918?tab=overview)"* to copy and paste your HTML code into Outlook signature box.


Note: With both Outlook and Gmail, the extension adds a little mailbox icon to the signature boxes toolbar. Click the icon and a popup will open to allow the copy/paste of html code.
