<h3>HTML email signatures look great but please note there an abundance of compatibility and support issues.  </h3>
<p>I'm not sure why html signature support is not uniform across all the email giants. 
  Where Apple mail supports SVG's, gmail doesn't. 
  Where some providers strip the head out of the code and others don't, I don't know why. 
  I do know there are <strong>some things worth avoiding. </strong>
  - Media Queries. Save yourself the headache. Usually they don't work at all, but when they do, parts won't work in all email browsers. 
  - Desktop versions. Again without safe media queries, you are likely going to have shrinking and font dilation on mobile. Just make a mobile version and be happy it works. 
  - SVG's. I learned the hard way. Gmail support just isn't there.
